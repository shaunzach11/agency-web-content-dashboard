# Agency Web Content Management Dashboard

A small front-end project that simulates an Illinois-style agency dashboard
for managing public web pages and Microsoft 365 / SharePoint documents.

It loads mock data from JSON files and lets users:

- View summary statistics for pages and documents
- Filter website pages by status and accessibility score
- Search for pages by title or URL
- Filter documents by library, sensitivity, and whether they are synced to Teams

Built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. Designed to demonstrate:

- Web content management thinking
- Basic dashboard UI design
- Accessibility awareness (WCAG-style fields)
- Familiarity with Microsoft 365 / SharePoint concepts
